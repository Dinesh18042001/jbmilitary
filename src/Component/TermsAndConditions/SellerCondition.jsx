                  Once goods are received, they will be added to a Vendor
                  Agreement, outlining the items received and the sellers
                  premium/fee as a percentage (eg. 15%). Once this vendor
                  agreement is received by the sellers, they must sign and

                  electronically, by mail, in person or included with the items
