                reports or elsewhere are statements of JB Military Antiques
                opinion and not representations of fact. Estimates may not be

              </li>
              <li>
                JB Military Antiques advises Bidders to attend the auction, but

            <ol>
              <li>
                The auctioneer has discretion to refuse bids, withdraw or
                re-offer lots for sale (including after the fall of the hammer)
                if (s)he believes that there may be an error or dispute, and may
                also take such other action as (s)he reasonably deems necessary.
              </li>
              <li>
                The auctioneer will commence and advance the bidding in such
                increments as (s)he considers appropriate and is entitled to
                place bids on the Seller’s behalf up to the Reserve Price for
                the lot, where applicable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Subject to Condition 7(a), the contract between the Buyer and
                the Seller is concluded on the striking of the auctioneer’s
                hammer.
              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Title in a lot will not pass to the Buyer until JB Military

                Military Antiques will generally not release a lot to a Buyer
                before payment. Earlier release shall not affect passing of
                title or the Buyer’s obligation to pay the Purchase Price, as
                above.
              </li>
              <li>
                The refusal of any licence or permit required by law, as
                outlined in Condition 6, shall not affect the Buyer’s obligation
                to pay for the lot, as per Condition 8(a).
              </li>
              <li>
                The Buyer must arrange for courier collection of lots within 10

                discretion of the seller. Fees associated with posting to the
                Buyer or returned lots to the Seller will include the actual
                postage charge and any packing costs accrued by JB Military
                Antiques. JB Military Antiques is not liable for such postage
                costs and all costs associated are entirely the responsibility
                of the Buyer or Seller to clear Lots they have sole tile within
                10 working days.
              </li>
              <li>
                All packing and handling of lots is at the Buyer’s risk. JB

                  Re-sell the lot by auction or privately, with estimates and

                  Buyer will be liable for any shortfall between the original
                  Purchase Price and the amount achieved on re-sale, including
                  all costs incurred in such re-sale;

             <p>The Guarantee lasts for 90 days after the date of the relevant auction, is for the benefit of the Buyer only and is non-transferable. “Counterfeit” means an item of Property that in JB Military Antiques reasonable opinion is an imitation created with the intent to deceive over the authorship, origin, date, age, period, culture or source, where the correct description of such matters is not included in the catalogue description for the Property.</p>
             <p>Property shall not be considered Counterfeit solely because of any damage and/or restoration and/or modification work (including, but not limited to, traces of mounting, tooling or repatinating). Please note that this Guarantee does not apply if either the catalogue description was in accordance with the generally accepted opinions of scholars and experts at the date of the sale, or the catalogue description indicated that there was a conflict of such opinions; or the only method of establishing at the date of the sale that the item was a Counterfeit would have been by means of processes not then generally available or accepted, unreasonably expensive or impractical; or likely to have caused damage to or loss in value to the Property (in JB Military Antiques opinion).</p>

             <p>To claim under this Guarantee, the Buyer must notify JB Military Antiques. in writing within one (1) month of receiving any information that causes the Buyer to question the authenticity or attribution of the Property, specifying the lot number, date of the auction at which it was purchased and the reasons why it is believed to be Counterfeit; and return the Property to JB Military Antiques in the same/unaltered condition as at the date of sale and be able to transfer good title in the Property, free from any third party claims arising after the date of the sale.</p>

             <p>JB Military Antiques has discretion to waive any of the above requirements. JB Military Antiques requires the Buyer to obtain at the Buyer’s cost the reports of two independent and recognised experts in the relevant field and acceptable to JB Military Antiques. These experts will have physically examined the item in question, meaning photographs and email exchange only is not an acceptable form of expert judgement. JB Military Antiques shall not be bound by any reports produced by the Buyer, and reserves the right to seek additional expert advice at its own expense. In the event JB Military Antiques decides to rescind the sale under this Guarantee, it may refund to the Buyer the reasonable costs of up to two mutually approved independent expert reports, provided always that the costs of such reports have been approved in advance.</p>
